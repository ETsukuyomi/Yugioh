                 and the deck is very consistent ending on Golden Lord and backrow.

                note of is the amount of rock support that has been printed in the past. There were already a<br>
                lot of strong cards that supported rock decks, but there has never been a good deck to be used in.

                  Shaddoll Invoked which was around before events were cancelled are also returning due to the strength of an end board

                the opponent, but is now  more consistent. Their combo is easily stopped however if you know how<br>
                what they do and can be prone to bricking

                resource manage effectively and knowing when to use the counter trap Salamangreat Rage properly. With Jack Jaguar being able to 
                recycle monsters while being a free summon and Gazelle being able to foolish burial the traps means that the deck is still relatively
                consistent, but not as consistent as before.

            <td class="currentTopDecksDesc">With the new card Animadorned Archosaur and True King Lithosagym released from the banlist at 1, Dinosaurs
                are making a comeback. The general end board usually consists of Evolzar Dolkka or Laggia, amd Ultimate Conductor Tyranno with a 
                possible Miscellaneousaurus in hand for protection. What some decks are doing is running the one Barrier Statue of the Storms to end on
                using Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty. The deck is relatively consistent with the amount of searching/dumping available.

            <td class="currentTopDecksDesc">With all the massive hits that Sky Striker have been hit with, the deck is now incredibly difficult to
                pilot properly. With Engage now banned, the overall consistentcy of the deck has fallen and along with their grind game. Similar to
                Zoodiacs, the deck was highly consistent and mainly ended on the same board every time which, although was not strong, it could be
                repeated every turn even if the board would be broken every turn. The deck requires a lot more critical thinking and one misstep 
                could cost the whole game. Sky Striker is a tier 2 deck in capable hands, but a tier 3 or 4 if the player can't think a few steps
                ahead.

            <td class="currentTopDecksDesc">The control heavy subterror deck has been barely hanging on in the current meta. Although the deck is
                still relatively consistent as Hidden City is a one card combo, the pure version is still very fragile. The deck relies on blowout
                cards if the die roll is lost such as Lightning Storm, and Nibiru the Primordial Being. Of course, the deck also loses to Lightning
                Storm as the deck is backrow heavy.

            <td class="currentTopDecksDesc">A previous topping deck that is attempting to return is the control deck Altergeist. With Multifaker back
                at three from the previous one, players are trying to revamp the deck to fit the current meta. Although the deck does fall short as 
                the deck is not too consistent and it does take some time for it to gain momentum. The deck generally ends on a monster bounce and
                whatever backrow they managed to draw. It's very weak going second as they heavily rely on their one monster effect to go through.
